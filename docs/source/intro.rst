Introduction
============

This repository contains all scripts to reproduce the results from the paper "Evolution of ultra conserved elements by indels".

All scripts require Python 3.4 or above, plus some Python libraries (pickle, numpy, seaborn, etc.; for a complete list, please check the imports in the first lines of each script).

Input files for the scripts are available to download at the UCSC website (links provided in the documentation).
